Math Doodles
============

I want to learn linear algebra. I never studied it in school, and it's been a long time since I studied all the prereqs.
Years ago, Rob Mee suggested the idea of studying math by writing tests. This may not be what he meant, but it was a
good idea. Also, there were some things that I wanted to try expressing as code. That's what this repository is about.

I'm pretty sure the rest of the world won't find this as interesting as I do. Oh well.

My appreciation to Kenneth Reitz and Navdeep Gill for their work to create a template for projects like this.
I used their tool located at https://github.com/navdeep-G/samplemod and it was very helpful.
