Math Doodles
============

I want to learn linear algebra. I never studied it in school.
It's been many years since I studied the prereqs.
The prereqs now include more, and different, material: e.g. algebra teaches unit rate conversions that were covered in
chemistry when I was in high school.
As part of studying/re-learning math, there are some fun facts that can be turned into code. That's what this repository is about.

I'm pretty sure the rest of the world won't find this as interesting as I do. Oh well.

My appreciation to Kenneth Reitz and Navdeep Gill for their work to create a template for projects like this.
I used their tool located at https://github.com/navdeep-G/samplemod and it was very helpful.
